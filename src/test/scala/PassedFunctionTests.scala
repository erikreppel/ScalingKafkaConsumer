/*
* This is mainly just a stub for the tests your function should pass,
* since you could really name your function anything and these tests would fail.
* Be a good person, write good tests.
* A good function to pass to the consumer should take an Array[Byte] and an Int,
* and return a Boolean value. Other than that, write what ever tests you need.
*
* (The consumer will fail if your function doesn't return true. This is so you
* can specify a condition to stop the consumer if a message isn't processed
* properly, I.E.)
